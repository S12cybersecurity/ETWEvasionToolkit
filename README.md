Toolkit of Projects to attack and evade Event Trace for Windows

## ETW Ghost Logger

ETW Ghost Logger is a project within the ETW Evasion Toolkit designed to stealthily intercept and log Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events in a target process. By hooking into the EtwEventWrite function, it captures and analyzes system events without detection, providing detailed insights into event data in both hexadecimal and ASCII formats.
